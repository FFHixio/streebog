GOST R 34.11-2012 hash function with 512/256 bit digest
=======================================================

About
-----
This is portable implementation of the GOST R 34.11-2012 hash function. The
standard developed by the Center for Information Protection and Special
Communications of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation with
participation of the Open joint-stock company "Information Technologies and
Communication Systems" (InfoTeCS JSC).

Requirements
------------
* GCC, Clang or ICC compiler supporting 64-bit integers.

* GNU make (or any compatible make).

Compile and install
-------------------
The software is smart enough to detect the most suitable configuration for
running hardware and software platform. In almost all cases it is sufficient
just to type 'make' on top of the source directory:

# make
gcc46 -g -O2 [other compile options..]

This will produce binary program file named 'gost3411' - is ready to use.

Usage instructions
------------------

# ./gost3411 -h
usage: [-25bhqrt] [-s string] [files ...]

Flags:
 -2 - 256-bit digest.
 -5 - 512-bit digest (default).
 -t - Testing mode to produce hash for example messages defined in standard.
 -b - Benchmark mode (to see how fast or slow this implementation works).
 -s - Print a checksum of the given string.
 -r - Reverses the format of the output. This helps with visual diffs.
 -q - Quiet mode - only the checksum is printed out.

Each file listed on the command line is processed and hash is printed for each
one. Stdin is read as input when executed without arguments.

Compile-time options
--------------------
By default, compiler set in 'CC' environment variable is used, falling back to
'cc' unless set. You can quickly recompile source with another compiler by
setting CC:

# make CC=clang

Special target called 'remake' may need to be used to overwrite recently
compiled up-to date binary:

# make remake CC=icc

This will recompile sources from scratch using Intel C Compiler with default
flags. If you need to adjust these compiler flags, try to set them with CFLAGS
knob:

# make remake CFLAGS="-O3"
