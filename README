GOST R 34.11-2012 hash function with 512/256 bit digest
=======================================================

About
-----
This is portable implementation of the GOST R 34.11-2012 hash function. The
standard developed by the Center for Information Protection and Special
Communications of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation with
participation of the Open joint-stock company "Information Technologies and
Communication Systems" (InfoTeCS JSC).

Requirements
------------

Compile and install
-------------------
For most cases it is sufficient just to type make in top of source directory:

# make
gcc46 -g -O2 [other compile options..]

This will produce binary program file named 'gost3411'.

Usage instructions
------------------

# ./gost3411 -h
usage: [-25bhqrt] [-s string] [files ...]

Flags:
 -2 - 256-bit digest.
 -5 - 512-bit digest (default).
 -t - Testing mode to produce hash for example messages defined in standard.
 -b - Benchmark mode (to see how fast or slow this implementation works).
 -s - Print a checksum of the given string.
 -r - Reverses the format of the output. This helps with visual diffs.
 -q - Quiet mode - only the checksum is printed out.

Each file listed on the command line is processed and hash is printed for each
one. Stdin is read as input when executed without arguments.
