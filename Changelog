Changes with version 0.08                                           19 Jan 2013

	* Feature: boost performance on 32-bit systems by using 64-bit MMX XOR
	  instructions in XLPS.

	* Feature: Use 128-bit SSE2 for X on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems. For
	  latter this will decrease number of instructions in about two times when
	  XORing 512-bit block.

Changes with version 0.07											17 Jan 2013

	* Feature: boost performance on 32-bit systems by using SSE2.

	* Bugfix: padding function rewritten to less complex.

	* Bugfix: key generation function K replaced with XLPS macros to avoid
	  inlining issues when max inline instruction limit reached.
	
	* Bugfix: encryption function E inlined to comression g to avoid
	  compile-time inlining issues when max inline instruction limit reached.
	
	* Bugfix: use unsigned integers where possible.

	* Bugfix: fix typo in update() when comparing bufsize.

	* Bugfix: memory allocator rewritten to use posix_memalign().

Changes with version 0.06                                           09 Jan 2013
	
	* Feature: performance optimization in LPS: hint compiler to use eight
	  registers instead of union buffer.
	
	* Feature: performance optimization in permutation P: rotate matrix by
	  cyclic right shifting bits in source matrix columns to rows in
	  destination matrix.
	
	* Feature: as result of previous two optimizations: replace LPS macros
	  with improved macros XLPS.

	* Bugfix: improve constant table C presentation to avoid runtime
	  conversion in key generator K.
	
	* Bugfix: unroll key generation loop in encryptor E.

	* Bugfix: rename union member names according to their natural meaning.

Changes with version 0.05                                           24 Dec 2012

	* Feature: issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C.

	* Feature: performance optimization in LPS: execute substitution and
	  permutation within single loop.

Changes with version 0.04                                           17 Dec 2012

	* Bugfix: fixed memory leaks (make valgrind happy).

	* Bugfix: update code to work on 32-bit systems.

	* Bugfix: code improvement in Key generator K.

	* Feature: performance optimization in linear transformation L (based on
	  Assembler instructions generated by CLang).

Changes with version 0.03                                           16 Dec 2012

	* Bugfix: algorithm optimization in linear transformation L.

Changes with version 0.02                                           15 Dec 2012

	* Feature: Makefile improvements.

	* Bugfix: recent GCC version compatibility (GCC 4.7).

	* Bugfix: layout modification: isolate core from main program.

	* Bugfix: handle read errors with ferror().

Initial version 0.01                                                14 Dec 2012

	GOST R 34.11-2012 hash function with 512/256 bits digest.
